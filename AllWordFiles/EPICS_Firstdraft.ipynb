    "##  Problem Statement\n",
    "In the agricultural sector, early detection of plant diseases is crucial to avoid severe crop loss. Most farmers, particularly in rural communities, have no access to specialized advice or technical expertise to detect leaf diseases in advance. This not only delays treatment but also allows diseases to spread across entire farms or communities, leading to large-scale crop failure and economic hardship. Lacking in timely interventions, farmers resort to ineffective or expensive solutions that further influence their livelihood. Our solution seeks to bridge this gap by offering an accessible, bilingual, ML-driven app to diagnose diseases early and provide actionable insights and solutions for prevention and cure."

    "##  Proposed Solution\n",
    "We propose **AgriScan**, a machine learning-based mobile application designed to help farmers identify leaf diseases by simply uploading an image of the affected leaf. The app will analyze the image and provide:\n",

    "- Precautionary measures\n",
    "- Preventive and curative suggestions\n",
    "- Additional agricultural tips\n",

    "1. **Data Collection**: Curate a dataset of various leaf images (healthy and diseased).Using Kaggle.\n",
    "2. **Model Development**: Train a CNN (e.g., ResNet or MobileNet) for disease classification.\n",
    "3. **App Integration**: Integrate the model into a mobile application using frameworks like TensorFlow Lite.\n",
    "4. **UI/UX Design**: Design bilingual interface using Flutter or React Native.\n",
    "5. **Testing & Feedback**: Field-test with real users for feedback and improvement."
