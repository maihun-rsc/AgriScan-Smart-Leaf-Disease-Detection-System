## AgriScan: Smart Leaf Disease Detection System

**AgriScan : Smart Leaf Disease Detection System** is a project created for farmer welfare. Designed to resolve the issue of plant diseases, it uses leaf-based disease detection. The proposed mobile application will be a tool featuring intuitive UI with features dedicated towards educating farmers about how to prevent crop wastage and ensure a yield.

## Proposed Datasets to be used

**Plant Disease Dataset:** [Kaggle](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/ashishmotwani/tomato)
Leaf Disease Classification
Over 20k images of tomato leaves with 10 diseases and 1 healthy class. Images are collected from both lab scenes and in-the-wild scenes. The goal is to develop a lightweight model that can predict tomato leaf disease & deploy it offline on a mobile app.

Classes:

Late_blight
healthy
Early_blight
Septorialeafspot
TomatoYellowLeafCurlVirus
Bacterial_spot
Target_Spot
Tomatomosaicvirus
Leaf_Mold
Spidermites Two-spottedspider_mite
Powdery Mildew
