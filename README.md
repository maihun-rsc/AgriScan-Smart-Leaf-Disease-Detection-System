# AgriScan: Smart Leaf Disease Detection System

**AgriScan: Smart Leaf Disease Detection System** is a project created for farmer welfare. Designed to resolve the issue of plant diseases, it uses leaf-based disease detection.

The proposed mobile application will be a tool featuring an intuitive UI with features dedicated towards:
* Educating farmers about how to prevent crop wastage.
* Ensuring a healthier and more bountiful yield.

## Proposed Datasets to be used

### Plant Disease Dataset
* **Source**: [Kaggle](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/ashishmotwani/tomato)
* **Description**: The dataset contains over 20,000 images of tomato leaves with 10 diseases and 1 healthy class. Images are collected from both lab scenes and in-the-wild scenes.
* **Goal**: The objective is to develop a lightweight model that can predict tomato leaf disease and be deployed offline on a mobile app.
